- 👋 Hi, my name is Eunice Brandares, but you can call me 'Eu'.
- 👀 I'm very technical and data-driven, and I’m always interested in learning new programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning. Trying to incorporate my experience in Data Analytics with my degrees in Statistics and Business Analytics.
- 💞️ Aside from my passion for coding and data analytics, I also spend my time playing video games 🎮 (Valorant's my current obsession) or football ⚽. I'm all about team games/sports!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at eunicebrandares@gmail.com or connect with me on me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eunicebrandares/). I am open to collaboration, learning, and new opportunities in the tech industry.
